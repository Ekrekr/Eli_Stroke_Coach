# Eli-Stroke-Coach
A budget stroke coach prototype made using an Atmega 328-P chip and some other basic components.

All code required for a build is in Stroke_Coach.ino.

## Components
* Atmega 328-P chip (same as in arduino).
* A 1.5V power supply and a 4.5V power supply (I used AA batteries).
* LCD1602 module.
* Potentiometer for LCD1602 module.
* Passive buzzer.
* 16 mHz Crystal Oscillator.
* 2 x 22pF 50V ceramic disc capacitors.
* ADXL377 accelerometer.
* Either lots of wires and a bread board or a custom PCB.
* Casing (not provided).

## Circuity
In lieu of a proper circuit diagram, here is a prototype on a breadboard in a box.
